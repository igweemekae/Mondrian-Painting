# Mondrain Painting
This projects focuses on using the fundamental concepts of Grid & Flex to paint an artwork by Piet Mondrain.
Although he is best known for his abstract paintings made from squares and rectangles, 
Piet Mondrian started out painting realistic scenes. He especially liked painting trees. 
Can you see the shape of a tree in this painting? 
It shows how he began to develop his abstract style.
